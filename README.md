    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

*   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React)
*   **UI Components**: [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **AI**: Google Gemini via [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)

*   **Forms**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) & [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

## üìù How It Works

*   **State Management**: The application uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management.
*   **Local Storage**: All journal entries are saved directly in the user's browser `localStorage`. This means the data is persistent on their device but is not sent to any server.
*   **AI Insights**: When you request insights, the text from your journal entries is securely sent to a Genkit flow which uses the Google Gemini model to generate reflections. The insights are then displayed back to you without being stored.
